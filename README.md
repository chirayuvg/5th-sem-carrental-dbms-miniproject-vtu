# car-rental-web-application [MySQL and Python-FLASK]

This mini-project includes various features such as an admin and user login page, as well as a sign-up page. For a comprehensive understanding of the website and its implementation, please refer to the attached report, which includes detailed information and snapshots of the final result.
